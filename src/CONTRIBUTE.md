If you would like to help contribute to the Flutter documentation or website,
we’re happy to have your help! Anyone can contribute, whether you’re new to
the project or you’ve been around a long time, and whether you self-identify
as a developer, an end user, or someone who just can’t stand seeing typos.

For more ways to get involved in the Flutter community or to learn about us,
also visit the [Flutter community](/community) site.

Looking for the [Effective Dart]({{site.www}}/guides/language/effective-dart)?
This comprehensive style guide includes sections on programming style and
documentation.
