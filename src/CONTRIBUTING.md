If you would like to help contribute to the Flutter project,
we’re happy to have your help! Anyone can contribute, whether you’re new to
the project or you’ve been around a long time, and whether you self-identify
as a developer, an end user, or someone who just can’t stand seeing typos.

For more ways to get involved in the Flutter community or to learn about us,
also visit the [Flutter community](/community) page.

Looking for the [Effective Dart]({{site.www}}/guides/language/effective-dart)?
This comprehensive set of guides for the Dart language (which is used by Flutter),
includes guides on style, documentation, usage, and design.

# Types of contributor

You can contribute to the Flutter SDK or the Flutter website. There are two
levels of contributors:

* A _contributor_ has signed the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) and
  submittecd one or more patches.

* A _trusted contributor_ is granted commit access by gaining our trust and
  demonstrating a commitment to Flutter.

# Ways to contribute

We encourage you to reach out and join the conversation in a variety of ways.

An easy way to send feedback is to "thumbs up" issues important to you
