If you would like to help contribute to the Flutter project,
we’re happy to have your help! Anyone can contribute, whether you’re new to
the project or you’ve been around a long time, and whether you self-identify
as a developer, an end user, or someone who just can’t stand seeing typos.

For more ways to get involved in the Flutter community or to learn about us,
also visit the [Flutter community](/community) page.

Looking for the [Effective Dart]({{site.www}}/guides/language/effective-dart)?
This comprehensive set of guides for the Dart language (which is used by Flutter),
includes guides on style, documentation, usage, and design.
